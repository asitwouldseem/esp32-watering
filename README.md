# esp32-watering
Project log for an ESP32 controlled watering system.

## Requirements
- Must be able to stand alone of Home Assistant. If HA goes offline for whatever reason, no plants should die! 
- Fault tolerant. Strive for professional, accept that I am merely a maker. 
- Ability to control water 'dosage' -- good plant parents know that watering shouldn't neccesarily be done on a schedule, and not all plants require watering consistently.
- Moisture sensors are out of scope. There are plenty of commercial solutions out there already.
- Ability to detect when the storage tank runs dry and notify me.
- Packaged up in a neat, small profile package. No jiffy or 3D printed boxes. 
- Runs off USB-C. Probably 12V at this stage given the pumps and solenoids I'm seeing. 
- If possible, control from the ESP-32 D1 Mini form factor. I use a number of these prototyping boards already.
